# Data-Visualization-with-Python
One of the most important skills of successful data scientists and data analysts is the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and results in an accessible and stimulating way. In this course, I learned many ways to effectively visualize both small and large scale data.

I learned how to create different types of basic and advanced graphs and charts, such as: waffle charts, area charts, column charts, column charts, pie charts, scatter charts, word clouds, cartograms and more! I also gained hands-on experience in creating interactive dashboards.

I have used various Python data visualization libraries including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly and Dash.
